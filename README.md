# ComfyNet: Embedded Network for Thermal Comfort Research

## Note: class of 2025 branch has been published!

This repository provides the software and resources for ComfyNet, a wireless mesh network of multiple ESP32-based embedded sensor nodes. 

ComfyNet is designed to measure environmental factors crucial for thermal comfort research. Users can deploy ComfyNet's compact nodes anywhere within a space, enabling the collection of data on air velocity, temperature, humidity, and pressure. This data provides valuable insights into real-world thermal conditions.
